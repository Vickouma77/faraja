# HIV Support Services: Breaking Stigma and Building Hope

Living with HIV should not define a person's life. Our comprehensive support services provide medical care, emotional support, and community connection for people living with HIV.

## Comprehensive Care Approach

We offer holistic support that addresses all aspects of health and well-being:

### Medical Support
- Access to antiretroviral therapy (ART)
- Regular health monitoring

- Mental health workshops
- Crisis intervention

### Community Building
- Monthly support group meetings

## Breaking the Stigma

Stigma remains one of the biggest barriers to HIV care. We're actively working to change perceptions through:

- Community education campaigns
