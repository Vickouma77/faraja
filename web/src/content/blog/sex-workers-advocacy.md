# Advocacy in Action: Fighting for Sex Workers' Rights

For too long, sex workers have been marginalized, criminalized, and denied basic human rights. At Faraja Women, we stand with our sisters in the industry, advocating for dignity, safety, and respect.

## The Current Landscape

Sex workers face numerous challenges:
- Lack of legal protections
- Stigma and discrimination
- Violence and exploitation
- Limited access to healthcare
- Economic instability

## Our Advocacy Approach

We believe in harm reduction and human rights-based approaches:

### Policy Advocacy
- Working with local governments for decriminalization
- Pushing for comprehensive sex work laws
- Ensuring access to justice systems

### Community Support
- Safe spaces for sex workers
- Peer support networks
- Health and safety workshops
- Legal aid services

## Real Impact Stories

*"The advocacy work Faraja Women does saved my life. When I was assaulted, they connected me with legal support and helped me navigate the system. For the first time, I felt heard and protected."* - Anonymous Community Member

## Building Alliances

We're proud to collaborate with:
- Local sex worker organizations
- Human rights groups
- Healthcare providers
- Legal aid services

## The Road Ahead

Decriminalization and destigmatization are our goals. We envision a world where sex workers can work safely, access healthcare without judgment, and live with dignity.

*Every person deserves respect and human rights, regardless of their profession.*
